The Sunrise Bowl is the most fulfilling for vegetarians on the menu in my opinion. (There's a little bit of everything in it!) The deserts are out of this world, especially the chocolate cake."

Didnâ€™t expect to walk out of here full, but man I got a major food coma after eating (rice is AYCE btw).Ordering requires each person to order their own meat plate, since everyone gets there own pot and veggies/noodles. We tried both the choice and prime beef; both options were high quality  and well worth it, Iâ€™d recommend it!"
